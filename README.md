# my-TikTok-data-analysis
This repository is a data analysis and visualization project that involves TikTok and Spotify user data. TikTok data includes various metrics such as daily view counts, 
like counts, profile visits, etc. It also includes Spotify data, which consists of daily music listening durations.

The aim of the project is to measure the relationship between creativity and music listening. In this context, I aimed to measure creativity using daily TikTok views.
As creative content increases, my views also increase, and I attempted to understand how this correlates with my music listening habits.

Before selecting my daily TikTok views, I carefully examined my TikTok data to decide which parameters to use. I analyzed data between November 17, 2023, and January 15, 2024. 
During this process, I reviewed daily video views, likes, unique viewers (those who watched a video on my account for the first time), daily profile views,daily total followers, 
and gender distribution charts.

Additionally, I analyzed my daily listening on Spotify in milliseconds using data from the third quarter of 2023. Then, I created a graph to examine the correlation between my 
daily listening and daily video views. While there are occasional shifts in the graph, it is possible to say that there is a correlation between daily listening time and video views.
This partially confirms my hypothesis. However, for complete confirmation, I need to work with larger datasets and test it repeatedly.

In the continuation of the project, accuracy tests can be performed. Furthermore, a machine learning model could be developed to predict the average views of a video based on the
amount of music listened to.
